## 📌 Project Overview  
This is a simple decentralized application (dApp) built for my Blockchain course assignment.  
The project demonstrates how a Solidity smart contract interacts with a web-based frontend using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, **MetaMask**, and **Ethers.js** on the **Sepolia Testnet**.

The app includes:  
- Connecting to MetaMask  
- Writing a message to the blockchain  
- Reading a message from the blockchain  
- Incrementing a counter  
- Reading the counter  
- Resetting the contract
